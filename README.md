📋 Project Overview

This repository contains the monitoring logic and deviation analysis framework for High-Temperature Battery Aging Chambers.

In an EV battery production line, the aging phase is critical for the chemical activation of the cells. Maintaining a precise thermal environment ensures the stability of the Electrolyte-Electrode interface. A deviation of even a few degrees can result in inconsistent internal resistance, leading to massive scrap costs or potential safety hazards in the final vehicle.

🏗️ System Architecture
The system manages thermal tracking across two independent rooms, integrated directly with the factory's MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and ASRS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System).

📐 Control Parameters
Parameter Value / Range
Target Temperature $60°C$
Upper Limit ($T_{max}$) $63°C$
Lower Limit ($T_{min}$) $57°C$
Monitoring Density 50 High-Precision Sensors per Room
Critical Metrics Date, Time, Humidity, Temperature
Total Process Time 48 Hours (Continuous)

📉 Deviation Risk & Root Cause AnalysisIndustrial environments face constant thermal disturbances. This tracking system is designed to identify and flag the following Negative Effects:
- ⚡ Infrastructure Failure: Power cuts or HVAC system breakdowns.
- 🚪 Operational Disturbances: Frequent opening/closing of chamber doors or air leaks in the insulation.
- 🔧 Human Factors: Unscheduled maintenance interventions during the 48-hour cycle.
- 🌍 Environmental Factors: Significant external weather changes impacting the building's thermal envelope.

🔄 Workflow Logic: MES & ASRS Integration

The process is fully automated to ensure "Dark Factory" consistency:

1- Chamber Assignment: MES checks availability for Room 01 or Room 02.

2- In-Feeding: ASRS transfers the battery racks into the designated chamber.

3- Soaking Phase: The 48-hour timer begins only when the Stability Buffer ($57°C \le T \le 63°C$) is reached by all 50 sensors.

4- Continuous Validation: Real-time analysis of sensor data to detect spikes or drops.

5- Out-Feeding: ASRS extracts the batch once the 48-hour chemical activation is verified.
    
🔥 Safety & Fire Prevention ProtocolsBecause high-temperature aging involves batteries at high energy density, safety is the highest priority.
- Detection: High-sensitivity smoke and thermal runaway detection is Activated.
- Extinguishing: Automated fire suppression system is Tested and Fully Functional.
- Emergency Logic: In the event of a fire trigger, the ASRS is programmed to prioritize the evacuation of the affected racks to a safe quenching zone.

📐 Mathematical Validation
The system calculates the Thermal Stability Index (TSI) for every batch to ensure chemical uniformity:

$$TSI = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |T_{actual} - T_{target}|$$

A batch is only released if the $TSI$ remains below the Quality Threshold of 0.5.

💻 Logic Implementation (Python)The following abstracted logic represents how the system validates a 48-hour log file:

Python

import pandas as pd

def validate_aging_batch(data_file):
    """
    Validates sensor data against Gigafactory thermal constraints.
    """
    df = pd.read_csv(data_file)
    
    # Define constraints
    T_MIN, T_MAX = 57, 63
    
    # Check for violations
    violations = df[(df['temp'] < T_MIN) | (df['temp'] > T_MAX)]
    
    if not violations.empty:
        total_violation_time = len(violations) * (time_interval_minutes)
        return f"❌ FAILED: {total_violation_time} mins out of bounds."
    
    return "✅ PASSED: Thermal stability maintained."

🚀 How to Use
- Data Input: Place your 48-hour sensor logs in the /logs directory.
- Analysis: Run main.py to generate the stability report.
- Audit: Review the generated Deviation_Report.pdf for any quality risk prevention steps.

🔬 Chemical Quality Validation
The aging process follows a precise sequence to ensure optimal SEI layer formation and electrolyte stabilization.

### Thermal Constraints:
- **HT Rooms ($T_{set}$):** $60°C \pm 3°C$
- **LT Rooms ($T_{set}$):** $25°C \pm 3°C$

### Validation Formula:
A batch is flagged as **REJECTED** if it violates the stability condition:
$$T_{actual} \notin [T_{target} - 3, T_{target} + 3]$$
OR if the duration $t_{actual} < t_{required}$. 

Violations in these parameters lead to:
1. **Capacity Loss:** Incomplete chemical reaction.
2. **Safety Risks:** Internal resistance instability.
3. **Charging Failure:** Accelerated degradation of the anode/cathode.
